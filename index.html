        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Angela Gutierrez. I am a first year sociology major at the University of California Riverside. I am working towards getting my bachelor's degree and graduating in four years. I am interested in helping others while also learning from them. I am very passionate about my major and have already come to learn so much within my first year. I plan on building my networking and becoming more involved with clubs and organizations on campus during my second year. I am very hard-working and interested in many sociological theories and concepts. I am not completely sure what field or specification I am going into yet. Hopefully by the end of my second year I will know so I can start planning on how I am going to get there. When I have a goal in mind I am determined to try and accomplish it. 
<br><br>

        When it comes to my experience in working I have worked at Old Navy which helped me develop marketing skills and was my first job. I learned how to work as a team in a work setting. I am currently working at UCRâ€™s dining hall, Glasgow. I am a cashier and have learned what it is like to be working at the front of the restaurant while managing various other tasks. I have been trusted to be in charge of also training new cashiers. Many responsibilities come with this job like making sure I am counting the correct amount of students coming in to eat as well as process transactions properly. Some of my other teamwork and leadership skills stem from high school leadership classes. This was when I first started working towards becoming the leader I wished to be through hard work and creativity. I was in charge of numerous projects and executed them to the best of my ability. This ultimately contributed to a larger group of not only my classmates but as well as the school environment. 
<br><br>

        I am willing to learn and grow because I believe there is always room for improvement. I am looking to gain experience in not only my field of study but also in a professional work environment. With my major I am given a lot of options that I could possibly go into after university. I want to explore all of my options and learn more about my possible paths. By gaining experience I believe that it will better prepare me and help me explore my options. I am ready to learn and grow through every job opportunity I have.
